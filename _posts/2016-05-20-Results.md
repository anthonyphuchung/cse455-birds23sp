# AlexNet

When training AlexNet with 5 epochs, we achieved a training accuracy of 61.87% and a validation accuracy of 46.44%. When training AlexNet with 10 epochs, we achieved a training accuracy of 74.87% and a validation accuracy of 49.9%. We saw that throughout the training, there was substantiantial decrease in loss so we anticipated better performance in the testing accuracy. However, even with the substantial increase from 5 epochs to 10 epochs, we saw that the validation accuracy did not substantially increase. The images below depict loss over batches. The left image corresponds to 5 epochs and the right image corresponds to 10 epochs.

# ResNet18 

When training AlexNet with 5 epochs, we achieved a training accuracy of 59.84% and a validation accuracy of 48.56%. When training AlexNet with 10 epochs, we achieved a training accuracy of 91.90% and a validation accuracy of 73.73%. We saw that training with ResNet18 took a significant more time to fully run on the entire dataset. Unlike AlexNet, we saw that going from 5 epochs to 10 epochs, greatly improved the validation accuracy. To us, these results make sense as ResNet18 is a much deeper architecture compared to AlexNet so it can handle more complex representations and generalize better on unseen data, leading to higher performance in classification. The left image corresponds to 5 epochs and the right image corresponds to 10 epochs.
