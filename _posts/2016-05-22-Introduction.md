Our group participated in the Kaggle "Birds?" Competition. Our objective is to create an image classification program which could accurately categorize different bird types. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birds23sp/data) we will be working with is split up into training images and testing images as well as csv files of labels and samples. We will be training our image classification using the training images and verifying accuracy with the testing images.
